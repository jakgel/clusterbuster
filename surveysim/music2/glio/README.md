glio
====

A Python package for reading and writing Gadget, and Gadget-like, data files.
(glio ~ Gadget-like I/O.)

glio is released under the MIT licence (see LICENCE.md).
glio is compatible with Python 2.7.x and Python 3.x, and requires numpy.

New file types may be added by defining a schema for the header and block data,
and subclassing `SnapshotBase` (or one of its subclasses). See for example
`GadgetSnapshot` in `gadget.py` and `SPHRAYSnapshot` in `sphray.py`.

To load a Gadget-2 data file,

```python
>>> import glio
>>> s = glio.GadgetSnapshot('filename')
>>> s.load()
```

and similarly for the `SPHRAYSnapshot` class. Header data is accessible as

```python
>>> s.header.header_item
```

where valid `header_item` attributes are defined by the current class' header
schema. They can also be obtained as a list of strings, or looped through,

```python
>>> s.header.fields
['npart', 'mass', ... ]
>>> for (name, value) in s.header.iterfields():
>>>    # Do something with header data.
```

Block data is accessed similarly, and can be iterated over similarly,

```python
>>> s.ID
[array([1370534, 1370614, 1348895, ..., 1370615, 1370533, 1370531], dtype=uint32), ... ]
>>> s.fields
['pos', 'vel', 'ID', ... ]
>>> for (name, field) in s.iterfields():
>>>     # Do something with block data.
```

Each block data (`field` above) is a list, with each index `i` corresponding to
that block's particle data for Gadget particle type `i`. When reading from file,
if a block contains no data for a particle type `i`, an empty `numpy.ndarray` is
set for that particle type in the list; if a particle type is not valid for the
block, `None` is set.

For convenience, particle types may be aliased to readable attribute names.
A `dict` mapping the available attributes to their corresponding particle type indices is availabe as `s.ptype_aliases`.

For example, for a `GadgetSnapshot`,

```python
>>> s.ptype_aliases
{'star': 4, 'bulge': 3, 'gas': 0, 'boundary': 5, 'disk': 2, 'halo': 1}
>>> s.gas.pos is s.pos[0]
True
>>> s.star.vel is s.vel[4]
True
```

However, the alias attribute (e.g. `s.gas` or `s.star`) returns a `SnapshotView` object, which is read-only.
Modification of the snapshot data in general requires directly modifying the field list(s).

A snapshot can be written to file, optionally with a new filename,

```python
>>> import glio
>>> s = glio.GadgetSnapshot('filename')
>>> # Double all gas-particle smoothing lengths.
>>> s.hsml[0] *= 2
>>> s.save('new_filename')
```
